## Product Description:

### Colorado Healthy Homemade is a personal chef service based out of Denver. Their service provides the client with a chef who goes to their home, prepares a menu, shops for the food, and prepares and portions the meals for the week. At the moment, the chef leaves a paper write-up of the weeks meals supplemented with photos delivered by text. The client has requested that we produce a product that allows the chef to view the client, provide the weekly menu via a calendar, and upload photos for reference. The client will be able to login and view the menu (or previous menus) by week, view the photos, and leave feedback (likes, dietary restrictions, allergies). Any correspondence between chef and client would trigger an email notification.

## User Story:

### As a Client, I want to be able to visit a website that details the chef and services provided. Create an account to request a consultation. Once services begin, I will be able to view menu plans by week, review reference photos, and provide feedback directly to the chef. As a chef, I will be able to upload the weeks menu and reference photos by client and week. Also, receive feedback from the client about previous menu, menu items, dietary restrictions, portions, and allergies.
